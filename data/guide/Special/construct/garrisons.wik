!Garrisons

Garrisons allow you to reduce your military expenses by more efficiently housing your units. They will also lower the price of all military units purchased from the black market. Those first two benefits do not increase once 30% of your total land are made up of Camps, so use a calculator if you need to so that you don't exceed this 30% limit if you don't want to. Camps also increase the rate at which your black market refills, so you might want to use them if you buy all of your troops off the bazaar and are running low.
