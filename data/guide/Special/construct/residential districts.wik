!Residential Districts

While workers will live on unused land, residential districts are specifically designed for housing. As a result, they allow you to house a great deal more workers than otherwise. In general, at a low tax rate, markets will produce more cash. However, at higher tax rates (30-60%), tents will be more productive than markets. Remember that having a high tax rate lowers your maximum health.
