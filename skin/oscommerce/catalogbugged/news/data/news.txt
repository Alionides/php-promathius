It appears this time the skin care market is about to witness the &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217;<br /><br />Imagine a skin care product that is so intelligent it mimics our body&#8217;s own biological processes of making new skin cells. Imagine a skin care product that every time you use it provides your skin with the identical elements that replicate a new cell. Imagine a skin care product that counteracts the signs of the aging process and never slows down like our own biological processes do as we age. Imagine no longer&#8230;.<br /><br />Introducing&#8230; Cell-CPR&#8482;&#8230; &#8220;Resurrection of the skin&#8221; says CEO Richard Purvis!<br /><br />John Knowlton, Skin Nutrition&#8217;s Technical Director says, &#8220;Our skin is made up of multiple cells, which consist of complex elements, and these elements all have roles to play in ensuring optimal cell and skin health. This biological process is genetically engineered to run like a finely tuned machine and pretty much does so without disruption in our early years. What is not factored into the equation is damage we do to these elements by lifestyle and environmental aggressors, which not only age us prematurely, but hinder the cells from doing what they are supposed to do&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;As with a new cell, Cell-CPR&#8482; is made up of Phospholipids, Proteins (Enzymes, Oligopeptides, Amino Acids) , Mitochondria, Oxygen, Cytoplasm, Vitamins and Minerals, as well as proprietary ingredients that protect, repair, and stimulate skin stem cells, cell membranes, and DNA; increase the synthesis of Collagen and Elastin, promote the turnover of the outer layer of the skin, reduce cellular inflammation, inhibit pigmentation disorders, and increase oxygen respiration in the skin - all intelligently and optimally delivered via patent pending delivery and multi-encapsulation technologies&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;The end result is skin the way nature intended it to be&#8230; healthy, smooth, youthful, and radiant!&#8221;<br /><br />Richard Purvis goes on to say, &#8220;we have created some unbelievable products and technologies over the years, but Cell-CPR&#8482; is better than anything we could have imagined! If our skin came with a manufacturer&#8217;s maintenance elixir, this is what it would have come with! We are looking forward to the &#8216;world&#8217; launch of Cell-CPR&#8482; at Cosmoprof Bologna, Italy April 3-6, 2009&#8221;.||3||
