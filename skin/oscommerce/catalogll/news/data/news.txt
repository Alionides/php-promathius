It appears this time the skin care market is about to witness the &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217;<br /><br />Imagine a skin care product that is so intelligent it mimics our body&#8217;s own biological processes of making new skin cells. Imagine a skin care product that every time you use it provides your skin with the identical elements that replicate a new cell. Imagine a skin care product that counteracts the signs of the aging process and never slows down like our own biological processes do as we age. Imagine no longer&#8230;.<br /><br />Introducing&#8230; Cell-CPR&#8482;&#8230; &#8220;Resurrection of the skin&#8221; says CEO Richard Purvis!<br /><br />John Knowlton, Skin Nutrition&#8217;s Technical Director says, &#8220;Our skin is made up of multiple cells, which consist of complex elements, and these elements all have roles to play in ensuring optimal cell and skin health. This biological process is genetically engineered to run like a finely tuned machine and pretty much does so without disruption in our early years. What is not factored into the equation is damage we do to these elements by lifestyle and environmental aggressors, which not only age us prematurely, but hinder the cells from doing what they are supposed to do&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;As with a new cell, Cell-CPR&#8482; is made up of Phospholipids, Proteins (Enzymes, Oligopeptides, Amino Acids) , Mitochondria, Oxygen, Cytoplasm, Vitamins and Minerals, as well as proprietary ingredients that protect, repair, and stimulate skin stem cells, cell membranes, and DNA; increase the synthesis of Collagen and Elastin, promote the turnover of the outer layer of the skin, reduce cellular inflammation, inhibit pigmentation disorders, and increase oxygen respiration in the skin - all intelligently and optimally delivered via patent pending delivery and multi-encapsulation technologies&#8221;.<br /><br />&#8220;The end result is skin the way nature intended it to be&#8230; healthy, smooth, youthful, and radiant!&#8221;<br /><br />Richard Purvis goes on to say, &#8220;we have created some unbelievable products and technologies over the years, but Cell-CPR&#8482; is better than anything we could have imagined! If our skin came with a manufacturer&#8217;s maintenance elixir, this is what it would have come with! We are looking forward to the &#8216;world&#8217; launch of Cell-CPR&#8482; at Cosmoprof Bologna, Italy April 3-6, 2009&#8221;. ||3||
1235609139|Aurelius|SKIN NUTRITION LAUNCHES NUTRISSENTIALS LINE OF NATURALLY CLEAN, BIO-ACTIVE SKINCARE|Nutrissentials updates previous Essential Anti Oxidant line with newer ingredients and SN-NPS&#8482; technology Launch scheduled for Cosmoprof Bologna: April3-6, 2009|Los Angeles-Capitalizing on the latest ingredients and technologies available, Skin Nutrition revolutionizes the science of skincare with a new naturally clean, bio-active line of products called Nutrissentials, which replaces the original Essential Anti Oxidant line.<br /><br />&#8220;Within Nutrissentials, there are specific ingredients that were previously not available when we started the company 6 years ago, and they significantly increase the efficacy of our products,&#8221; states Richard Purvis, CEO of Skin Nutrition, a global skincare manufacturer based in the US. &#8220;These ingredients include patent-pending, nano-encapsulated nutritional extracts of super-berries, Plankton derived omega 3, fruit & seed oils, and spinach extract, for its high bio-available mineral content. Also included is a super-hybrid lipid soluble vitamin C that is 50 times more effective than regular vitamin C, as well as bio-available forms of amino acids and other phyto-active botanical extracts.&#8221;<br /><br />These ingredients are designed and chosen to work well with our body&#8217;s natural biological processes and are formulated into delivery systems that maximize their penetration into the skin, reducing inflammation and flushing out toxins. This allows the cells to receive optimal nourishment and maximum cellular regeneration, which slows down the premature aging process and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, resulting in the creation of younger, healthier-looking skin.<br /><br />&#8220;Even our preservation system was developed with our &#8216;clean&#8217; and &#8216;bioactive&#8217; philosophy,&#8221; continues Purvis. &#8220;Nutrissentials utilizes SN-NPS&#8482;, a first of its kind, proprietary patent-pending natural preservation system that is unlike the harsh chemical preservative systems that are used by so many other brands. SN-NSP&#8482;--Skin Nutrition Natural Preservative System--is one of the many unique points of difference that is going to propel Skin Nutrition into a true global leader within the field of scientific skincare.&#8221;<br /><br />Targeting women (and men) over 25, Nutrissentials includes a total of 9 products. &#8220;Of these, I highly recommend the Cleanser, Toner, Hydrating Mask, and Complexion Rejuvenating Serum because they really define the tremendous capabilities of this skincare system,&#8221; states Purvis.||3||

The show organizers do not award prizes, but unofficially, Skin Nutrition was called &#8220;the best brand&#8221; and &#8220;the best product&#8221; with &#8220;the best packaging&#8221; at the show. <br /><br />Skin Nutrition has had further successes in Europe and the Far East and is well ahead of its international roll-out plans. Skin Nutrition CEO, Richard Purvis said, &#8220;We have been overwhelmed, but delighted with the response. We knew we had a great product and felt it would be well received, but we never anticipated the kind of reaction we have been getting all over the world.&#8221; We have now secured distribution and top end retail and skin care clinic accounts in the US, UK, EU, several key Asian countries, and Australia.<br /><br />Skin Nutrition Technical Director/Formulator and internationally acclaimed cosmetic scientist John Knowlton C.Chem, MRSC, Dip Cos. Sci (GB) said, &#8220;We have pre-empted a trend by introducing a total body wellness concept that includes a range of state-of-the-art, technologically-advanced peptide face serums with significant wrinkle reduction, complexion enhancing and skin resurfacing properties; body treatments with highly active marine extracts that tone and restore, and nutritional supplements that reduce internal inflammation while  promoting healthy skin.&#8221;  <br /><br />Knowlton goes on to say, &#8220;Skin Nutrition takes a radically different approach to skin care and is treatment-based, rather than a typical &#8216;cleanse and moisturize&#8217;, for &#8216;different skin types&#8217; product.  The actinic ageing process affects everyone irrespective of &#8216;dry&#8217;, &#8216;oily&#8217;, or &#8216;combination&#8217; skin types and Skin Nutrition is 100% focused on targeting and reversing this. Skin Nutrition takes a bilateral approach, combating cellular inflammation internally, where premature ageing starts, and by repairing and reversing the visible signs of ageing on the surface of the skin.&#8221; <br /><br />Skin Nutrition will be available in April 2008 exclusively at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York, Beverly Hills, South Coast Plaza, Phoenix and Palm Beach Gardens as well as saks.com. <br /><br />Skin Nutrition is able to achieve results by way of utilizing the very latest, highly active, state-of-the-art and biotechnologically-engineered ingredients. Combined with the most potent botanical extracts from nature, they are utilized in synergistic blends at their maximum levels and delivered via uniquely designed excipients for maximum and optimal penetration.<br /><br />Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the world&#8217;s pre-eminent specialty retailers, is renowned for its superlative American and international designer apparel collections, its expertly edited assortment of handbags, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics and gifts, and the first-rate fashion expertise and exemplary client service of its Associates.
