Having recently been defeated by the Peloponnesian League led by Sparta, the Athenians have slowly managed to regain some of their former power and economic stability. The Athenians start with a stable food supply and a library of knowledge larger than any other in the known world. Their lands, on the other land, will begin weak. An Athenian military would begin moderately sized and will remain strongly defensive. In order for the Athenians to rise, a decisive early game would be critical. An Athenian player would tend to play non-aggressively and would only resort to aggressive actions in her own defence.
