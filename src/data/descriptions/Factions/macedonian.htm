Macedon or Macedonia (Greek: ?a?ed???a, Makedonía) was the name of a kingdom centred in the northernmost part of ancient Greece.[1] The homeland of the ancient Macedonians, it was bordered by the kingdom of Epirus to the west and the region of Thrace to the east. For a brief period, it became the most powerful state in the world after Alexander the Great conquered most of the world known to the Greeks, inaugurating the Hellenistic period of world history.
