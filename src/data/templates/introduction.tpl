It is the year 380 BC. The day is sunny and clear. You stand in front of your people and tribesmen. Respectfully, they await your words of wisdom.  Your heart beats. It beats because you inevitably know that your path to greatness has emerged.<br /><br />

A man dressed in soft linen apparrel hands you a piece of paper. On it, it reads: PROMATHIUS - The game of diplomacy, money and war. You read this very carefully. You search for some kind of hidden meaning, like the wise philosophers taught you. Unable to come to any wise conclusions, you remark bluntly "Why, good citizen, is it that I have been given a paper of such deceptive nature?"<br /><br />

The man stares at you blankly for a moment and mutters something in broken prose. Determined to find out an answer, you keep reading it. A game? Eventually you find a link between the key words and come to a conjecture. <br /><br />

You are about to enter a game that will pit you against the many other tribes, all with the objective of rising to become the most powerful empires in th known world. It will perhaps be them who determine how great you are; after all, if you are the leader of the greatest empire of all time, how much greater can you be? We are only mortals.<br /><br />

The name reminds you of an old Greek myth relating to the god Prometheus. The tale had it that more than ten thousand years ago, a once mortal man, originally by the name Promathius, led his people to rule the most powerful empire the world had ever seen. His influence was so powerful and his achievements were so unnaturally extraordinary, that gods believed he was too great to be a mere mortal. It was decided that he would be granted everlasting divinity and adopted the name of  Prometheus.<br /><br />

Because the story conflicted with other Greek religious conventions, it was not accepted as a true tale. You accept this as some kind of metaphor or a fanatical prophecy but as nothing more. Perhaps some day that may change...
