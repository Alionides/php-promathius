These are some of the rules for formatting in the wiki.

The titles use an exclamation mark !
! Large
!! Larger
!!! Largest

Styles use the simple apostrophe '
'''Fat'''
''italic''
'''''Fat and italic'''''

Underline using ' u '
'u'Word'u'

The numbered lists uses hash: #
#First
#Second
#Third 

The bulleted lists use star/asterisk *
* apple
* pear
* fish 

For HTML code, and all other coding where the formating is important use these special &quot;squiggely&quot; brackets:

{&lt;font color=red&gt; yes using a different text colour works too &lt;/font&gt;}

The external links and the email addresses are recognised automatially.  
http://www.rowlff.de/rowiki/
rowiki@rowlff.de

or through a text between square brackets with a pipe separating the text from the link:
[Visit the site of roWiki|http://www.rowlff.de/rowiki/]

Links to the wiki-pages use the square brackets:
[Reception]

If you want a different text for the link description, but want to refer to a wiki page use &quot;|?page=&quot; in front of the wiki page you refer to:
[The link descrcrition you want|?page=thewikipageyouwanttopointto]

To display an images inserting the URL of an image you want to see and it is automatically displaying the image
[http://www.chabel.org/scripts/TigerWiki/logo.gif]

An image with link uses again the pipe in front of the URL
[http://wwww]


If a page does not exist, it will be created with the first click on its link.
